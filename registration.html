    <p>The registration fee includes admission to all invited and contributed 
													sessions, a reception, refreshments, the conference dinner, and continental 
													breakfasts. 
    <p>There is an additional charge of <b>50 US Dollars</b> 
    if you wish to bring a partner to the conference dinner on the evening of 
    Sunday 5 January.<p>Proceedings for the workshop 
    will produced on CD-ROM and given to participants on arrival. We will also 
    produce a limited number of hard copy volumes of the papers for use at the 
    workshop. Please indicate on the registration page if you also require one 
    of these in addition to the CD-ROM.<p>Note that, 
    compared to the previous workshop in this series held at Key West in January 
    2001,&nbsp; these fees represent the combination of the workshop and 
    tutorial fees (since we have now combined the invited and contributed 
    sessions) plus a small increase due to inflation.
